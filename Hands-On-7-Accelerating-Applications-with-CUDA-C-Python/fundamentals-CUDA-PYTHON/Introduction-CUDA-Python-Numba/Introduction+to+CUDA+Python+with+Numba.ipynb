    "## What is Numba?\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba is a **just-in-time**, **type-specializing**, **function compiler** for accelerating **numerically-focused** Python for either a CPU or GPU. That's a long list, so let's break down those terms:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **function compiler**: Numba compiles Python functions, not entire applications, and not parts of functions.  Numba does not replace your Python interpreter, but is just another Python module that can turn a function into a (usually) faster function. \n",
    " * **type-specializing**: Numba speeds up your function by generating a specialized implementation for the specific data types you are using.  Python functions are designed to operate on generic data types, which makes them very flexible, but also very slow.  In practice, you only will call a function with a small number of argument types, so Numba will generate a fast implementation for each set of types.\n",
    " * **just-in-time**: Numba translates functions when they are first called.  This ensures the compiler knows what argument types you will be using.  This also allows Numba to be used interactively in a Jupyter notebook just as easily as a traditional application.\n",
    " * **numerically-focused**: Currently, Numba is focused on numerical data types, like `int`, `float`, and `complex`.  There is very limited string processing support, and many string use cases are not going to work well on the GPU.  To get best results with Numba, you will likely be using NumPy arrays."

How we have misused the GPU will help clarify what kinds of problems are well-suited for GPU computing, and which are best left to be performed on the CPU:\n",

If our calculation does not involve enough math operations (often called \"arithmetic intensity\"), then the GPU will spend most of its time waiting for data to move around.\n",

In those cases, it makes sense to send data to the GPU and keep it there until all of our processing is complete.\n",

Scalar code using data types that are 32 and 64-bit run basically the same speed on the CPU, and for integer types the difference may not be drastic, but 64-bit floating point data types may have a significant performance cost on the GPU, depending on the GPU type.  Basic arithmetic on 64-bit floats can be anywhere from 2x (Pascal-architecture Tesla) to 24x (Maxwell-architecture GeForce) slower than 32-bit floats. If you are using more modern GPUs (Volta, Turing, Ampere), then this could be far less of a concern.  NumPy defaults to 64-bit data types when creating arrays, so it is important to set the [`dtype`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/reference/arrays.dtypes.html) attribute or use the [`ndarray.astype()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.astype.html) method to pick 32-bit types when you need them.\n",

For example, computing the row sums of an array will return a 1 dimensional array for 2D array input, or 2D array for 3D array input."
